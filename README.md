# Agro-IT

This project helps farmers by engaging IT professionals and volunteers
<p><center>
Many local governments have plans to expand agro-tourism in order to boost the rural economy.
Sub-urban areas have a large white-collar population who may be interested in visiting and staying in farm-houses for a day as a tourist. 
Agro-IT app will allow us to connect these people and support growing rural business oppurtunities
