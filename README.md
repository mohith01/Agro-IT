# Mobile-App-for-Agro-Tourism
This project aims to connect tourists and farm-houses for fostering agro-tourism.

Many local governments have plans to expand agro-tourism in order to boost the rural economy. Sub-urban areas have a large white-collar population who may be intereseted in visiting farm-houses as a tourist. Agro-IT app will allow us to connect these people and support growing rural business oppurtunities 

<b>OBJECTIVES</b><br>
<ol>
<li>To tap the potential of Agro-tourism by connecting interested volunteers and farmhouses, and support the stakeholders by an additional source of income.</li>
<li>To provide a single comprehensive application that will allow the farmers to manage their farming and business activities.</li> 
<li>creating a network of such volunteers and grow it into a flourishing community will benefit both the farmers and the volunteers.</li>
